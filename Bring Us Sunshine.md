Bring Us Sunshine
=
(dedicated to Malte, Jan, Tiffany & Holger)

They bring sunshine, with a smile
They bring laughter, all the while
In this world where we live, there should be more happiness
So much joy that they give, to each brand new bright tomorrow

They make us happy, every year
Never bring us, any tears
Yes their arms, are as warm, as the sun from up above
They bring fun, they bring sunshine, they bring love
