Bring Us Sunshine
=
(dedicated to Malte, Jan, Tiffany & Holger and to the tune of "Bring Me Sunshine")

They bring sunshine, with a smile <br>
They bring laughter, all the while <br>
In this world where we live, there should be more happiness <br>
So much joy that they give, to each brand new bright tomorrow <br>

They make us happy, every year <br>
Never bring us, any tears <br>
Yes their arms, are as warm, as the sun from up above <br>
They bring fun, they bring sunshine, they bring love <br>
