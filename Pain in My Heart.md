Pain in My Heart
=
(in regards to the Ajax bug that IOS 6 introduced)

This pain in my heart, oh yes it's true<br>
It makes me angry and often makes me blue<br>
This pain in my heart, oh the things that we all go through

This pain in my heart, it makes me sigh<br>
I’m never laughin', sometimes it makes me cry<br>
This pain in my heart, I’d like to roll up in a great big ball and die

Ooooo baby, you know it's true<br>
Deep down in my heart dear<br>
There is no love for bugs like you

This pain in my heart, it drives me mad<br>
It’s never good because it feels so bad<br>
This pain in my heart, caused by the worst bug I’ve ever had
