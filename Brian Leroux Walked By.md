Brian Leroux Walked By
=
(to the tune of "Orange Colored Sky")

I was walking along, minding my business <br>
When there he was that PhoneGap guy <br>
(Jan & Max) Flash! Bam! Alacazam! <br>
Ooo Brian Leroux walked by <br>

I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine <br>
When there he sat, drinkin a brew <br>
(Jan & Max) Flash! Bam! Alacazam! <br>
Oh my goodness thereâ€™s Brian Leroux <br>

One look and I said timber! <br>
Watch out for falling glass <br>
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out I went into a spin and I started to shout he is it.. he is it... he is it... I-T IT! <br>

I was walking along, minding my business <br>
When there he was and so we cried <br>
(Jan & Max) Flash! Bam! Alacazam! <br>
In airports, conferences, and local bars <br>
He might be an assassin or a spy <br>
(Jan & Max) Flash! Bam! Alacazam! <br>
What a guy!!! <br>
