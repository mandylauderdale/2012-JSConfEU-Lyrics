Brian Leroux Walked By
=

I was walking along, minding my business 
When there he was that PhoneGap guy
(Jan & Max) Flash! Bam! Alacazam!
Ooo Brian Leroux walked by

I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine 
When there he sat, drinkin a brew
(Jan & Max) Flash! Bam! Alacazam!
Oh my goodness thereâ€™s Brian Leroux

One look and I said timber!
Watch out for falling glass
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out I went into a spin and I started to shout he is it.. he is it... he is it... I-T IT!

I was walking along, minding my business 
When there he was and so we cried
(Jan & Max) Flash! Bam! Alacazam!
In airports, conferences, and local bars
He might be an assassin or a spy
(Jan & Max) Flash! Bam! Alacazam!
What a guy!!!
