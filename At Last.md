At Last
=
(in regards to the iPhone 5 finally being released)

At last, my love has come along
My lonely days are over
Cause you and I belong

At last, you’re screen I think it grew
And how I love your passbook
It was worth standing in long line for you

I found a phone that I could speak to
A phone that I can call my own
It’s such a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Your maps, your maps, kill me now, they’re so bad
But your camera, oh it’s heaven
And I poopin'd Jan, at last :-)
