At Last
=
(in regards to the iPhone 5 finally being released and to the tune of "At Last")

At last, my love has come along <br>
My lonely days are over <br>
Cause you and I belong <br>

At last, you’re screen I think it grew <br>
And how I love your passbook <br>
It was worth standing in long line for you <br>

I found a phone that I could speak to <br>
A phone that I can call my own <br>
It’s such a thrill to press my cheek to <br>
A thrill that I have never known <br>

Your maps, your maps, kill me now, they’re so bad <br>
But your camera, oh it’s heaven <br>
And I poopin'd Jan, at last :-) <br>
