Masochism Tango  
=
(this song is usually about S&M, but this version is dedicated to QA engineers; this is to the tune of "Masochism Tango")

I ache for the touch of your grip, dear <br>
But much more for the touch of your whips, dear <br>
Cause you can raise welts like nobody else <br>
As we dance to the masochism tango <br>

Let our love be a flame not an ember <br>
Yes it’s you that I want to dismember <br>
Blacken your eye, set fire to your tie <br>
As we dance to the masochism tango <br>

At your command, before me here you stand <br>
My heart is in your hand, it's here that I must be <br>
Your heart entreats, just hear those savage beats <br>
Now go put on your cleats and come and trample me <br>

My heart is hard as stone or mahogany <br>
That's why I'm in exquisite agony <br>
My soul is on fire, a flame with desire <br>
Which is why you perspire when we tango <br>

You caught my soul in your left castanet, love <br>
I can feel the pain yes, love, you treat me like I am dumb <br>
And I envy the rose that you hold in your teeth, dear <br>
With the thorns underneath, dear, piercing into your gums <br>

Your eyes cast a spell that bewitches <br>
Last time, yes, I needed twenty stitches <br>
To sew up the gash you made with your lash <br>
As we danced to the masochism tango <br>

Bash in my brain and make me scream with pain <br>
You’ll  kick me once again, just say we'll never part <br>
I know too well, I’m underneath your spell <br>
So buddy if you smell something burning it's my heart <br>

Take a cigarette from its holder <br>
So you can burn your initials in my shoulder <br>
Fracture my spine, just swear that you're mine <br>
As we dance to the masochism, masochism tango! <br>
