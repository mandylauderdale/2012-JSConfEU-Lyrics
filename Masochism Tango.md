Masochism Tango  
=
(this song is usually about S&M, but this version is dedicated to QA engineers)

I ache for the touch of your grip, dear
But much more for the touch of your whips, dear
Cause you can raise welts like nobody else
As we dance to the masochism tango

Let our love be a flame not an ember
Yes it’s you that I want to dismember
Blacken your eye, set fire to your tie
As we dance to the masochism tango

At your command, before me here you stand
My heart is in your hand, it's here that I must be
Your heart entreats, just hear those savage beats
Now go put on your cleats and come and trample me

My heart is hard as stone or mahogany
That's why I'm in exquisite agony
My soul is on fire, a flame with desire
Which is why you perspire when we tango

You caught my soul in your left castanet, love
I can feel the pain yes, love, you treat me like I am dumb
And I envy the rose that you hold in your teeth, dear
With the thorns underneath, dear, piercing into your gums

Your eyes cast a spell that bewitches
Last time, yes, I needed twenty stitches
To sew up the gash you made with your lash
As we danced to the masochism tango

Bash in my brain and make me scream with pain
You’ll  kick me once again, just say we'll never part
I know too well, I’m underneath your spell
So buddy if you smell something burning it's my heart

Take a cigarette from its holder
So you can burn your initials in my shoulder
Fracture my spine, just swear that you're mine
As we dance to the masochism, masochism tango!!!
