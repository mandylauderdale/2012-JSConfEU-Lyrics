Bei Mir Bist Du Schon
=
(Mandy's first impression of Joe McCann at SXSW in 2006)

Of all the bald men I’ve known and I’ve known some
Until we met at SXSW I was lonesome
You had some diamond studs in your ears and a gold chain that 
hung down to here
I admit, you looked a little gangster to me

You loved my Dead Kennedys t-shirt and I pretended to be a fan
You made my laptop run so much faster and I thought I should keep this man
And so I’ve racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you mean to me

Bei mir bist du schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist du schon means that you’re grand
Oh bei mir bist du schon, it’s such an easy refrain
It means you’re the fairest in the land

I could say Joey Joey, even say wundabar
Each language only helps me tell you, darling, how grand you are
I’ve tried to explain, bei mir bist du schon
Please kiss me and say you understand
