Bei Mir Bist Du Schön

(Mandy's first impression of Joe McCann at SXSW in 2006 and to the tune of "Bei Mir Bist Du Schön")

Of all the bald men I’ve known and I’ve known some <br>
Until we met at SXSW I was lonesome <br>
You had some diamond studs in your ears and a gold chain that 
hung down to here <br>
I admit, you looked a little gangster to me <br>

You loved my Dead Kennedys t-shirt and I pretended to be a fan <br>
You made my laptop run so much faster and I thought I should keep this man <br>
And so I’ve racked my brain, hoping to explain <br>
All the things that you mean to me <br>

Bei mir bist du schön, please let me explain <br>
Bei mir bist du schön means that you’re grand <br>
Oh bei mir bist du schön, it’s such an easy refrain <br>
It means you’re the fairest in the land <br>

I could say Joey Joey, even say wunderbar <br>
Each language only helps me tell you, darling, how grand you are <br>
I’ve tried to explain, oh bei mir bist du schön <br>
Please kiss me and say you understand <br>
