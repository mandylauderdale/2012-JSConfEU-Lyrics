One Monkey Don't Stop No Show
=
(Mandy left Ruby for JavaScript)

I jumped up this mornin<br>
And sat on the side of the bed<br>
I said I'm leavin you Ruby<br>
When I use you, I feel dead<br>
Cause you're way too bulky, so you’ve gotta go<br>
And it's high time darlin', it’s high time you should know

One monkey don't stop no show<br>
One monkey don't stop no show<br>
I’ve found something else to use instead<br>
And I mean every single word I said

Ruby thought I was jivin'<br>
Just couldn’t use it anymore<br>
I scrapped it at 3 in the morning but guess what<br>
I was using JavaScript at 4<br>
You see some languages cry when you have to let them go<br>
But I found out something a long time ago

One monkey don't stop no show<br>
One monkey don't stop no show<br>
So when it gets too big for it’s pants<br>
Just use JavaScript, give it a chance

I used to be chicken hearted<br>
I’d cry and throw myself on the floor<br>
Cause I was just new and naive<br>
Ha, I ain't like that no more<br>
Cause I learned the hard way<br>
And I learned the score<br>
But guys I’m here to tell ya<br>
And darlins I should know

One monkey don't stop no show<br>
One monkey don't stop no show<br>
Cause you can do anything you choose<br>
Go tell that Ruby, you’re not amused

One monkey don't stop no show<br>
One monkey don't stop no show<br>
One monkey don't stop no show<br>
JavaScript is the best way to go
