One Monkey Don't Stop No Show
=
(Mandy left Ruby for JavaScript)

I jumped up this mornin
And sat on the side of the bed
I said I'm leavin you Ruby
When I use you, I feel dead
Cause you're way too bulky, so you’ve gotta go
And it's high time darlin', it’s high time you should know

One monkey don't stop no show
One monkey don't stop no show
I’ve found something else to use instead
And I mean every single word I said

Ruby thought I was jivin'
Just couldn’t use it anymore
I scrapped it at 3 in the morning but guess what
I was using JavaScript at 4
You see some languages cry when you have to let them go
But I found out something a long time ago

One monkey don't stop no show
One monkey don't stop no show
So when it gets too big for it’s pants
Just use JavaScript, give it a chance

I used to be chicken hearted
I’d cry and throw myself on the floor
Cause I was just new and naive
Ha, I ain't like that no more
Cause I learned the hard way
And I learned the score
But guys I’m here to tell ya
And darlins I should know

One monkey don't stop no show
One monkey don't stop no show
Cause you can do anything you choose
Go tell that Ruby, you’re not amused

One monkey don't stop no show
One monkey don't stop no show
One monkey don't stop no show
JavaScript is the best way to go
