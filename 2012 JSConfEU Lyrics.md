Brogrammer Drama

Brogrammer drama
Poppin his collar and raging on code
Brogrammer drama
He’s not a CEO, he’s a CEBro
He spends a lot of precious time mean muggin' in aviators
He only dines on Muscle Milk to him there’s nothing greater!

Stay in the roid zone
While getting a tan down at the pool
Hoodies and headphones
Doesn’t give a damn he thinks he looks cool
Give him some Redbull and Mountain Dew to prep for conference season 
Oh nevermind he drinks it like water for no good reason

Brogrammer drama
Just got a new tribal tattoo
Brogrammer drama
His dance moves were on the news
He does his pushups with one hand while coding with the other
He’s patenting some caffeine pills called May I Have Another?

He has 5 startups 
Hired some guys from the local frat
In his Porche doing fistpumps
And his rottweiler ate your cat
He’s good with the ladies, loves Nickleback, and gets so mad he shakes 
He has his laptop strapped to the treadmill and loves brotein shakes
Brogrammer drama, kindof like high school
Brogrammer drama, so much like high school
Brogrammer drama, oooo-weeee-ooooo!


You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You
=

You’re nobody till you’ve tasted Michael Rogers’ coffee
You’re nobody till Max Ogden has mapped your cat
If you haven’t tried Aaron Quince’s bacon, oh you’re missin out
When Felix live codes a MySQL parser in node, I want to scream and shout

The world isn’t the same after you’ve ridden in a delorean
As sure as James Welton is under age
You’re nobody till Paolo has randomly decided to stay at your loft during SXSW
So go and find Chris Williams and safe rage!


Bei Mir Bist Du Schon
=
(Mandy's first impression of Joe McCann at SXSW in 2006)

Of all the bald men I’ve known and I’ve known some
Until we met at SXSW I was lonesome
You had some diamond studs in your ears and a gold chain that 
hung down to hear
I admit you looked a little gangster to me

You loved my Dead Kennedys t-shirt and I pretended to be a fan
You made my laptop run so much faster and I thought I should keep this man
And so I’ve racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you mean to me

Bei mir bist du schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist du schon means that you’re grand
Oh bei mir bist du schon, it’s such an easy refrain
It means you’re the fairest in the land

I could say Joey Joey, even say vundabar
Each language only helps me tell you, darling, how grand you are
I’ve tried to explain, bei mir bist du schon
Please kiss me and say you understand


Brian Leroux Walked By
=

I was walking along, minding my business 
When there he was that PhoneGap guy
(Jan & Max) Flash! Bam! Alacazam!
Ooo Brian Leroux walked by

I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine 
When there he sat, drinkin a brew
(Jan & Max) Flash! Bam! Alacazam!
Oh my goodness there’s Brian Leroux

One look and I said timber!
Watch out for falling glass
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out I went into a spin and I started to shout he is it.. he is it... he is it... I-T IT!

I was walking along, minding my business 
When there he was and so we cried
(Jan & Max) Flash! Bam! Alacazam!
In airports, conferences, and local bars
He might be an assassin or a spy
(Jan & Max) Flash! Bam! Alacazam!
What a guy!!!


Pain in My Heart
=
(in regards to the Ajax bug that IOS 6 introduced)

This pain in my heart, oh yes it's true
It makes me angry and often makes me blue
This pain in my heart, oh the things that we all go through

This pain in my heart, it makes me sigh
I’m never laughin', sometimes it makes me cry
This pain in my heart, I’d like to roll up in a great big ball and die

Ooooo baby, you know it's true
Deep down in my heart dear
There is no love for bugs like you

This pain in my heart, it drives me mad
It’s never good because it feels so bad
This pain in my heart, caused by the worst bug I’ve ever had


One Monkey Don't Stop No Show
=
(Mandy left Ruby for JavaScript)

I jumped up this mornin
And sat on the side of the bed
I said I'm leavin you Ruby
When I use you, I feel dead
Cause you're way too bulky, so you’ve gotta go
And it's high time darlin', it’s high time you should know

One monkey don't stop no show
One monkey don't stop no show
I’ve found something else to use instead
And I mean every single word I said

Ruby thought I was jivin'
Just couldn’t use it anymore
I scrapped it at 3 in the morning but guess what
I was using JavaScript at 4
You see some languages cry when you have to let them go
But I found out something a long time ago

One monkey don't stop no show
One monkey don't stop no show
So when it gets too big for it’s pants
Just use JavaScript, give it a chance

I used to be chicken hearted
I’d cry and throw myself on the floor
Cause I was just new and naive
Ha, I ain't like that no more
Cause learned the hard way
And I learned the score
But guys I’m here to tell ya
And darlins I should know

One monkey don't stop no show
One monkey don't stop no show
Cause you can do anything you choose
Go tell that Ruby, you’re not amused

One monkey don't stop no show
One monkey don't stop no show
One monkey don't stop no show
JavaScript is the best way to go


At Last
=
(in regards to the iPhone 5 finally being released)

At last, my love has come along
My lonely days are over
Cause you and I belong

At last, you’re screen I think it grew
And how I love your passbook
It was worth standing in long line for you

I found a phone that I could speak to
A phone that I can call my own
It’s such a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Your maps, your maps, kill me now, they’re so bad
But your camera, oh it’s heaven
And I poopin'd Jan, at last :-)

Fine iFrame
=
(someone told me that I couldn't create a song about iFrames... pwned!)

He's got some fine iframes
Alex Sexton that is his name
He’s alright with me but all I can see
Are his fine iFrames

How long have you been around
Alex, so glad you came into town
I wanna scream cause I've never seen
Such fine iFrames

Vampire skin can be so rare
But you man are king of the throne
You are no square, I love your red hair
And your code is so well known

You’ve got some fine iFrames
Alex Sexton that is his name
He’s alright with me, but all I can see

Anything Goes
=
(about what goes on in the tech industry)

Times have changed
Conferences and meetup groups
Checking Twitter to get the scoop
Hope no one takes my phone and says I pooped
Yes, today
Make a phone call, are you insane
Spending half my life on a plane
My devices are frying my brain

In olden days you’d write a letter
But email is so much better
Because we all know, mail is too slow

My mom told me I should get a degree
But I can learn all I wanna know online, any fuckin time
Your industry rocks today
Great talks today 
Gourmet coffee today 
Free booze today
And a rave today
Yes, all of that today
You lucky, so-and-so’s
And though Nuno’s a great romancer 
And has all the geeky answers
Where’s the fire hose, cause anything goes 

If mechanical bulls you like 
Gun duels like
Helicopters you like
Phil Collins you like
If free phones you like 
Clowns and donkeys you like
And pirate themed clothes 
And when each night the vibe is jumpin and recruiters
Wine and dine you with hell who knows... 
Anything Goes 



Bring Us Sunshine
=
(dedicated to Malte, Jan, Tiffany & Holger)

They bring sunshine, with a smile
They bring laughter, all the while
In this world where we live, there should be more happiness
So much joy that they give, to each brand new bright tomorrow

They make us happy, every year
Never bring us, any tears
Yes their arms, are as warm, as the sun from up above
They bring fun, they bring sunshine, they bring love
