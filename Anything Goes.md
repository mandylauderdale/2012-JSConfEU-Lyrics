Anything Goes

(about what goes on in the tech industry; to the tune of "Anything Goes")

Times have changed <br>
Conferences and meetup groups <br>
Checking Twitter to get the scoop <br>
Hope no one takes my phone and says I pooped <br>

Yes, today <br>
Make a phone call, are you insane <br>
Spending half my life on a plane <br>
My devices are frying my brain <br>

In olden days you’d write a letter <br>
But email is so much better <br>
Because we all know, mail is too slow <br>

My mom told me I should get a degree <br>
But I can learn all I wanna know online, any fuckin time <br>

Your industry rocks today <br>
Great talks today <br>
Gourmet coffee today <br>
Free booze today <br>
And a rave today <br>
Yes, all of that today <br>
You lucky, so-and-so’s <br>

And though Nuno’s a great romancer <br>
And has all the geeky answers <br>
Where’s the fire hose, cause anything goes <br>

If mechanical bulls you like <br>
Gun duels like <br>
Helicopters you like <br>
Phil Collins you like <br>
If free phones you like <br>
Clowns and donkeys you like <br>
And pirate themed clothes <br>

And when each night the vibe is jumpin and recruiters <br>
Wine and dine you with hell who knows <br>
Anything goes <br>
