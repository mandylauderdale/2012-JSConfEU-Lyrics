Anything Goes
=
(about what goes on in the tech industry and to the tune of the Broadway song, "Anything Goes")

Times have changed


Conferences and meetup groups


Checking Twitter to get the scoop


Hope no one takes my phone and says I pooped


Yes, today


Make a phone call, are you insane


Spending half my life on a plane


My devices are frying my brain



In olden days you’d write a letter


But email is so much better


Because we all know, mail is too slow



My mom told me I should get a degree


But I can learn all I wanna know online, any fuckin time


Your industry rocks today


Great talks today 


Gourmet coffee today 


Free booze today


And a rave today


Yes, all of that today


You lucky, so-and-so’s


And though Nuno’s a great romancer


And has all the geeky answers


Where’s the fire hose, cause anything goes



If mechanical bulls you like


Gun duels like


Helicopters you like


Phil Collins you like


If free phones you like 


Clowns and donkeys you like


And pirate themed clothes 


And when each night the vibe is jumpin and recruiters


Wine and dine you with hell who knows


Anything Goes
