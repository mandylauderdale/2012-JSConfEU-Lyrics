My Favorite Things
=
(this song does not have anything to do with the tech scene, but it does have to do with another scene that I recently made light of at a "posh" event in Austin, TX)

Botox and facelifts and boob jobs and fillers
Mansions with pool boys and porches with pillars
Xanax, tequila, and big diamond rings
These are a few of my favorite things

My sugar daddy, I’m killing him slowly
Little bits of arsenic in his ravioli
Designer strollers and huge SUVs
These are a few of my favorite things

My perfect children have private school tutors
Too bad my girls will one day work at Hooters
To shut them up I just give them caffeine
No wonder they all have ADHD!

Dinner parties, black tie galas
Oh my life is rad
The Vicodin is working, I can’t feel a thing
And that’s why I never, feel bad
