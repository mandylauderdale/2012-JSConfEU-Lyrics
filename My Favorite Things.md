My Favorite Things
=
(this song does not have anything to do with the tech scene, but it does have to do with another scene that I recently made light of at a "posh" event in Austin, TX; this is to the tune of "My Favorite Things"
)

Botox and facelifts and boob jobs and fillers <br>
Mansions with pool boys and porches with pillars <br>
Xanax, tequila, and big diamond rings <br>
These are a few of my favorite things <br>

My sugar daddy, I’m killing him slowly <br>
Little bits of arsenic in his ravioli <br>
Designer strollers and huge SUVs <br>
These are a few of my favorite things <br>

My perfect children have private school tutors <br>
Too bad my girls will one day work at Hooters <br>
To shut them up I just give them caffeine <br>
No wonder they all have ADHD! <br>

Dinner parties, black tie galas <br>
Oh my life is rad <br>
The Vicodin is working, I can’t feel a thing <br>
And that’s why I never, feel bad <br>
