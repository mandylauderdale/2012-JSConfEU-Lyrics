Brogrammer Drama

(to the tune of "Beauty School Dropout")

Brogrammer drama <br>
Poppin his collar and raging on code <br>
Brogrammer drama <br>
He’s not a CEO, he’s a CE-Bro <br>
He spends a lot of precious time mean muggin' in aviators <br>
He only dines on Muscle Milk to him there’s nothing greater! <br>

Stay in the roid zone <br>
While getting a tan down at the pool <br>
Hoodies and headphones <br>
Doesn’t give a damn, he thinks he looks cool <br>
Give him some Redbull and Mountain Dew to prep for conference season <br>
Oh nevermind, he drinks it like water for no good reason <br>

Brogrammer drama <br>
Just got a new tribal tattoo <br>
Brogrammer drama <br>
His dance moves were on the news <br>
He does his pushups with one hand while coding with the other <br>
He’s patenting some caffeine pills called "May I Have Another?" <br>

He has 5 startups <br> 
Hired some guys from the local frat <br>
In his Porsche doing fistpumps <br>
And his rottweiler ate your cat <br>
He’s good with the ladies, loves Nickleback, and gets so mad he shakes <br>
He has his laptop strapped to the treadmill and loves bro-tein shakes <br>
Brogrammer drama, kind of like high school <br>
Brogrammer drama, so much like high school <br>
Brogrammer drama, oooo-weeee-ooooo! <br>
