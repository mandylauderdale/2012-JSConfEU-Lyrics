Brogrammer drama
Poppin his collar and raging on code
Brogrammer drama
He’s not a CEO, he’s a CE-Bro
He spends a lot of precious time mean muggin' in aviators
He only dines on Muscle Milk to him there’s nothing greater!

Stay in the roid zone
While getting a tan down at the pool
Hoodies and headphones
Doesn’t give a damn, he thinks he looks cool
Give him some Redbull and Mountain Dew to prep for conference season 
Oh nevermind, he drinks it like water for no good reason

Brogrammer drama
Just got a new tribal tattoo
Brogrammer drama
His dance moves were on the news
He does his pushups with one hand while coding with the other
He’s patenting some caffeine pills called "May I Have Another?"

He has 5 startups 
Hired some guys from the local frat
In his Porsche doing fistpumps
And his rottweiler ate your cat
He’s good with the ladies, loves Nickleback, and gets so mad he shakes 
He has his laptop strapped to the treadmill and loves bro-tein shakes
Brogrammer drama, kind of like high school
Brogrammer drama, so much like high school
Brogrammer drama, oooo-weeee-ooooo!
