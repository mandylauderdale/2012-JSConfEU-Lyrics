Fine iFrame

(someone told me that I couldn't create a song about iFrames... pwned! this is to the tune of "Fine Brown Frame")

He's got some fine iframes <br>
Alex Sexton that is his name <br>
He’s alright with me but all I can see <br>
Are his fine iFrames <br>

How long have you been around <br>
Alex, so glad you came into town <br>
I wanna scream cause I've never seen <br>
Such fine iFrames <br>

Vampire skin can be so rare <br>
But you man are king of the throne <br>
You are no square, I love your red hair <br>
And your code is so well known <br>

You’ve got some fine iFrames <br>
Alex Sexton that is his name <br>
He’s alright with me, but all I can see <br>
Are his fine iFrames <br>
