Fine iFrame

(someone told me that I couldn't create a song about iFrames... pwned!)

He's got some fine iframes
Alex Sexton that is his name
He’s alright with me but all I can see
Are his fine iFrames

How long have you been around
Alex, so glad you came into town
I wanna scream cause I've never seen
Such fine iFrames

Vampire skin can be so rare
But you man are king of the throne
You are no square, I love your red hair
And your code is so well known

You’ve got some fine iFrames
Alex Sexton that is his name
He’s alright with me, but all I can see
Are his fine iFrames
