You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You

(a highlight of some special geeks in the community; to the tune of "You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You")

You’re nobody till you’ve tasted Michael Rogers’ coffee <br>
You’re nobody till Max Ogden has mapped your cat <br>
If you haven’t tried Aaron Quint’s bacon, oh you’re missin' out <br>
When Felix live codes a MySQL parser in node, I want to scream and shout <br>

The world isn’t the same after you’ve ridden in a Delorean <br>
As sure as James Welton is under age <br>
You’re nobody till Paolo has randomly decided to stay at your loft during SXSW <br>
So go and find Chris Williams and safe rage! <br>
