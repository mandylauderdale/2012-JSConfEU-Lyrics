You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You
=

You’re nobody till you’ve tasted Michael Rogers’ coffee
You’re nobody till Max Ogden has mapped your cat
If you haven’t tried Aaron Quint’s bacon, oh you’re missin' out
When Felix live codes a MySQL parser in node, I want to scream and shout

The world isn’t the same after you’ve ridden in a Delorean
As sure as James Welton is under age
You’re nobody till Paolo has randomly decided to stay at your loft during SXSW
So go and find Chris Williams and safe rage!
