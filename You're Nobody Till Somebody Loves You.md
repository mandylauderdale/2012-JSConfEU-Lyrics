You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You
=

You’re nobody till you’ve tasted Michael Rogers’ coffee<br>
You’re nobody till Max Ogden has mapped your cat<br>
If you haven’t tried Aaron Quint’s bacon, oh you’re missin' out<br>
When Felix live codes a MySQL parser in node, I want to scream and shout

The world isn’t the same after you’ve ridden in a Delorean<br>
As sure as James Welton is under age<br>
You’re nobody till Paolo has randomly decided to stay at your loft during SXSW<br>
So go and find Chris Williams and safe rage!
